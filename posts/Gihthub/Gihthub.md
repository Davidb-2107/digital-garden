GitHub is a version-control platform for hosting development projects.



# Publish your repository
1.  Create a GitHub repo on Github.com.
2.  Copy the remote endpoint.
3.  Run `git init` locally.
4.  Add the remote endpoint.
5.  Specify which items to push into GitHub with a .gitignore file.
6.  Stage files.
7.  Add a commit message.
8.  Push to the repo.

A lot of steps means a lot of work.

Visual Studio Code has a built-in publishing feature that fully automates this process and allows you to do it right from the Visual Studio Code interface.
